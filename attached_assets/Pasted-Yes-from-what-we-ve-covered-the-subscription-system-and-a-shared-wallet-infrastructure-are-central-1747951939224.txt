Yes, from what we’ve covered, the subscription system and a shared wallet infrastructure are central components of your app’s business model — but they haven’t yet been fully integrated into your GitHub structure. Here’s how to bring them into alignment:

⸻

1. Shared Wallet System (Runner + Requester)

Proposed Structure:

src/
├── (auth)/
│   └── wallet/
│       ├── WalletDashboard.tsx         # Unified view for both roles
│       ├── AddFundsModal.tsx           # Top-up interface
│       ├── TransactionHistory.tsx      # Past charges, refunds, rewards
│       └── RequestRefundModal.tsx      # Refund request UI

Functionality:
	•	Balances stored via Supabase/Firebase per user
	•	Used for:
	•	Paying for errands
	•	Crediting earnings (for runners)
	•	Refunding canceled errands
	•	Holding promotional credits or bonuses
	•	Connects to Stripe, WiPay, or Lynk

2. Subscription Tiers Integration

Proposed Structure:

src/
├── (auth)/
│   └── subscription/
│       ├── SubscriptionPage.tsx        # View & select plans
│       ├── PlanDetailsModal.tsx        # Show benefits of each
│       └── ManageSubscription.tsx      # Change/cancel plan

Backend Fields to Add:

users {
  subscriptionPlan: 'basic' | 'premium' | 'business',
  subscriptionStartDate: timestamp,
  errandsUsedThisCycle: number,
  billingStatus: 'active' | 'past_due' | 'canceled',
  walletBalance: number,
  role: 'requester' | 'runner' | 'both'
}

Logic Integration:
	•	On checkout, check errandsUsedThisCycle vs allowed plan
	•	If exceeded, apply appropriate surcharge or deny
	•	Discounts and perks applied based on subscriptionPlan

3. Admin Panel Enhancements

pages/
├── admin/
│   ├── ViewSubscriptions.tsx        # All users & plans
│   ├── BillingOverview.tsx          # Payment issues / alerts
│   └── WalletManagement.tsx         # Admin credit/debit

Next Steps

Would you like to:
	1.	Add the folder structure and placeholder components into your GitHub repo?
	2.	Start with wallet logic first (refunds, earnings, etc.) or subscription UI first?
	3.	Generate database schema for Firebase/Supabase tracking of subscriptions and wallets?

Just let me know which direction you want to move first and I’ll scaffold it with precision.
